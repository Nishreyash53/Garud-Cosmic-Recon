# Garud-Cosmic-Recon
A futuristic browser-based space simulation using AI hand tracking to control a stealth spacecraft. Built with Three.js and MediaPipe, featuring gesture-based navigation, cinematic HUD, and real-time AI vision.
Garud: Cosmic Recon

Garud: Cosmic Recon is a futuristic browser-based space combat and reconnaissance simulation that demonstrates AI-driven human–machine interaction. The project allows players to control a stealth spacecraft using real-time hand gestures via webcam, creating a neural-link–style experience.

Built with Three.js for 3D rendering and MediaPipe Hand Tracking for AI vision, this project combines modern WebGL graphics, cinematic UI, and gesture-based controls into a single immersive simulation.

⚠️ This is a fictional concept project created for learning, experimentation, and portfolio showcase purposes only.
